# Python Object Oriented Programming (OOPS)

In Python, Object Oriented Programming (OOPS) is a programming paradigm that allows
to organize data and functions together to form a model of real-world objects.
Objects in OOPS encapsulate both data and functions.

## Key concepts of OOPS in Python:

1. Class: A blueprint or template from which objects are created.
2. Object: An instance of a class.

## Types of OOPS in Python:
3. Inheritance: One class can inherit features from another class.

4. Encapsulation: Hiding the data members and providing access to it
    through methods.

5. Polymorphism: One interface to different data types.

6. Abstraction: The process of simplifying complexities and presenting
    simplified view of the real world.


## Inheritance in Python

Inheritance in Python allows a class (child class) to inherit features from another class (parent class).
This is achieved by specifying the parent class after colon `:` in the class definition.

Example:

## Encapsulation in Python

Encapsulation in Python allows to encapsulate data members inside a class and provide methods to access them.
This is achieved using special methods and private names for the data members.
