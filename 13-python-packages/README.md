# What is a Package?

A package is a collection of modules that are related to each other. They can contain functions, classes, and variables. 




# __init__.py

This file is used to indicate that the directory containing this file is a package. This file 

When a package is imported, Python looks for a file named __init__.py in the package directory. If it exists, it is imported as a module.
this file is executed first when the package is imported.

Having an __init__.py file in a directory is what signals to Python that the directory should be treated as a package.
Without this file, Python will not recognize the directory as a package, and you won't be able to use relative imports or perform other package-related operations.
