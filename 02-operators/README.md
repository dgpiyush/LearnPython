# Python Operators and its use

<!-- operator list -->

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators
- Bitwise operators


## Arithmetic operators

- -  ( + ) -> Addition
- -  ( - ) -> Subtraction
- -  ( * ) -> Multiplication
- -  ( / ) -> Division
- -  ( % ) -> Modulus
- -  ( ** ) -> Exponentiation
- -  ( // ) -> Floor division

### Example:

```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x + y)  # Output: 15
print(x - y)  # Output: 5
print(x * y)  # Output: 50
print(x / y)  # Output: 2.0
print(x % y)  # Output: 0
print(x ** y)  # Output: 1000
print(x // y)  # Output: 2
```

## Assignment operators

- -  ( = ) -> Simple assignment
- -  ( += ) -> Augmented assignment
- -  ( -= ) -> Augmented assignment
- -  ( *= ) -> Augmented assignment
- -  ( /= ) -> Augmented assignment
- -  ( %= ) -> Augmented assignment
- -  ( //= ) -> Augmented assignment
- -  ( **= ) -> Augmented assignment
- -  ( &= ) -> Augmented assignment
- -  ( |= ) -> Augmented assignment
- -  ( ^= ) -> Augmented assignment
- -  ( >>= ) -> Augmented assignment
- -  ( <<= ) -> Augmented assignment


### Example:

```python
x = 10
x += 5
print(x)  # Output: 15
```


## Comparison operators

- -  ( == ) -> Equal to
- -  ( != ) -> Not equal to
- -  ( > ) -> Greater than
- -  ( < ) -> Less than
- -  ( >= ) -> Greater than or equal to
- -  ( <= ) -> Less than or equal to


### Example:

```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x == y)  # Output: False
print(x != y)  # Output: True
print(x > y)  # Output: True
print(x < y)  # Output: False
print(x >= y)  # Output: True
print(x <= y)  # Output: False
```

## Logical operators

- -  ( and ) -> Logical AND
- -  ( or ) -> Logical OR
- -  ( not ) -> Logical NOT


### Example:

```python
x = True
y = False
print(x and y)  # Output: False
print(x or y)  # Output: True
print(not x)  # Output: False
```

## Identity operators

- -  ( is ) -> Identity
- -  ( is not ) -> Identity


### Example:

```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x is y)  # Output: False
print(x is not y)  # Output: True
```


## Membership operators

- -  ( in ) -> Membership
- -  ( not in ) -> Membership


### Example:

```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x in y)  # Output: False
print(x not in y)  # Output: True
```


## Bitwise operators

- -  ( & ) -> Bitwise AND
- -  ( | ) -> Bitwise OR
- -  ( ^ ) -> Bitwise XOR
- -  ( ~ ) -> Bitwise NOT
- -  ( << ) -> Bitwise left shift
- -  ( >> ) -> Bitwise right shift


### Example:

```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x & y)  # Output: 0
print(x | y)  # Output: 15
print(x ^ y)  # Output: 15
print(~x)  # Output: -11
print(x << y)  # Output: 100
print(x >> y)  # Output: 0
```
