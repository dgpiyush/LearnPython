## What is a Python Virtual Environment

A Python Virtual Environment, also known as a Virtual Environment, is an isolated working copy of Python which has its own site-packages directory and can be used to work on a specific project.

This allows you to work on multiple projects with different dependencies without having to worry about conflicts between them.

## Steps to create and activate a Virtual Environment in both Unix and Windows:

### Unix (Linux, Mac OS X)

1. Create a Virtual Environment:

    `python -m venv myprojectenv`

2. Activate the Virtual Environment:

    `source myprojectenv/bin/activate`


### Windows

1. Create a Virtual Environment:

    `python -m venv myprojectenv`

2. Activate the Virtual Environment:

    `myprojectenv\Scripts\activate`



### Deactivate the Virtual Environment

`deactivate`
